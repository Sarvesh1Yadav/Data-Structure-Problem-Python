Problem - You are given with an array of size n where arr[i] represents the number on the ith book and an integer shelfsize which represents number of book in each shelf.
Your task is to return True if the books can be arranged into shelves of shelfsize consecutive number otherwise false.

class solution:
    def canArrangeBooks(self, books, shelfSize):
        #Write your code here...
        n = len(books)
        books.sort()
        if shelfSize==1:
            for i in range(n-1):
                if books[i]==books[i+1]:
                    return False
            return True
        else:
            
            for i in range(0,n,shelfSize):
                end = min(i+shelfSize,n)
                for j in range(i,end-1):
                    if books[j]==books[j+1]:
                        return False
                    
            return True
