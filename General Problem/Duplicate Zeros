Problem Statement - You are given an integer array arr. Your task is to duplicate every occurrence of 0, shifting the remaining elements to the right. 
The length of the array stays fixed, so elements beyond the original array length are not considered.
Modify the input array in-place without returning anything.

class solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr):
        #Write your code here...
        n = len(arr)

        i=0
        while i<n:
            if arr[i]==0:
                for j in range(n-1,i,-1):
                    arr[j]=arr[j-1]
                if i+1<n:
                    arr[i]=0
                    
                
                i+=2
            else:
                
                i+=1
