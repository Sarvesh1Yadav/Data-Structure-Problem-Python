Problem Statement - Sort an array in ascending order by inserting unsorted position to correct position. Tell number of swaps to sort the array
class solution:
    def countSwaps(self, arr, n):
        #Write your code here...
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            swapped = False
            for j in range(0,n-i-1):
                if arr[j]>arr[j+1]:
                    arr[j],arr[j+1]=arr[j+1],arr[j]
                    count+=1
                    swapped = True
            if not swapped:
                break
        return count
