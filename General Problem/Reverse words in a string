Problem Statement - You are given a string text. Your task is to reverse the sequence of words in the string.
A word is defined as a continuous sequence of non-space characters, and these words are typically separated by spaces within the string text.
The goal is to return a string with these words in reverse order, with each word separated by a single space.

class solution:
    def reverseWords(self, text):
        #Write your code here...
        words = text.split()
        rev_words= words[::-1] 
        return " ".join(rev_words)
