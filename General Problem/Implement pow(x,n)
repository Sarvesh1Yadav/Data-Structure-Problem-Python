Problem Statement - You are given two numbers: a floating-point number x and an integer n. Your task is to implement a function that calculates x raised to the power of n (i.e., x‚Åø).
You need to handle both positive and negative values of n. If n is negative, return the reciprocal of the result for the positive exponent.

class solution:
    def xPowN(self, x, n):
        # Write Your Code Here...
        
        if n==0:
            return 1
        if n<0:
            return 1/self.xPowN(x,-n)
        half = self.xPowN(x,n//2)
        if n%2==0:
            return half*half
        else:
            return x*half*half
