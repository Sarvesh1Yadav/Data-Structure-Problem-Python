Problem Satement - 
You’re given an integer n.Your task is to return an array, arr, with length (n+1) such that for each i,where for each index i (0 ≤ i ≤ n):
arr[i] = the number of 1's in the binary representation of i

class solution:
  def countSetBits(self, n):
          # Write your code here...
          l = []
          l.append(0)
          for i in range(1,n+1):
              count = 0
              temp = i
              while temp:
                   temp = temp&(temp-1)
                   count+=1
              l.append(count)
          return l
