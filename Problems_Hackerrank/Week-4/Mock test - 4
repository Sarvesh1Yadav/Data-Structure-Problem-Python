Problem statement - Two words are anagramsof one another if their letters can be rearranged to form the other word.
 Given a string, split it into two contiguous substrings of equal length. Determine the minimum number of
 characters to change to make the two substrings into anagrams of one another.


def anagram(s):
    # Write your code here
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    n = len(s)
    mid = n//2
    if n%2!=0:
        return -1
    
    s1 = s[:mid]
    s2 = s[mid:]
    from collections import Counter
    
    c1 = Counter(s1)
    c2 = Counter(s2)
    
    diff = c1 - c2 
    return sum(diff.values())
