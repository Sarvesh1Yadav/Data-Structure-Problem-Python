Problem Statement - A space explorer's ship crashed on Mars! They send a series of SOS messages to Earth for help.
Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string, , determine how many letters of the SOS message have been changed by radiation
