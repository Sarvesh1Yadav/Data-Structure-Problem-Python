Problem Statement - An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly STEPS steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill,U , or a downhill, D step.
Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude.Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.


import math
import os
import random

import sys

def countingValleys(steps, path):
    # Write your code here
    level = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(steps):
        if level==-1:
            if path[i]=='U':
                level+=1
                count+=1
            else:
                level-=1
        else:
            if path[i]=='U':
                level+=1
            else:
                level-=1
    return count
            
        

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    steps = int(input().strip())

    path = input()

    result = countingValleys(steps, path)

    fptr.write(str(result) + '\n')

    fptr.close()
