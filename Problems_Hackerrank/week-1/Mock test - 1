Problem Statement - The median of a list of numbers is essentially its middle element after sorting. The same number of
elements occur after it as before. Given a list of numbers with an odd number of elements, find the median?


def findMedian(arr):
     # Write your code here
     x = sorted(arr)
     m = (len(arr)+1)//2
     return x[m-1]
