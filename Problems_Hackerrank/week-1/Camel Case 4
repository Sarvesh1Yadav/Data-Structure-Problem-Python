Problem statement - Camel Case is a naming style common in many programming languages.
In Java, method and variable names typically start with a lowercase letter, with all subsequent words starting with a capital letter (example: startThread). 
Names of classes follow the same pattern, except that they start with a capital letter (example: BlueCar).
Your task is to write a program that creates or splits Camel Case variable, method, and class names.


# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
def camelCase(str):
    operation, type_, line = str.split(";")
    
    if operation == "S":
        words = []
        temp = ""
        for char in line:
            if char.isupper():
                if temp:
                    words.append(temp)
                temp = char.lower()
            else:
                temp += char
        words.append(temp)
        if type_ == "M":
            words[-1] = words[-1].replace('()', '')
        return " ".join(words)
    
    else:
        words = line.split()
        if type_ == "C":
            return "".join([w.capitalize() for w in words])
        elif type_ == "V":
            return words[0] + "".join([w.capitalize() for w in words[1:]])
        else:
            return words[0] + "".join([w.capitalize() for w in words[1:]]) + "()"
