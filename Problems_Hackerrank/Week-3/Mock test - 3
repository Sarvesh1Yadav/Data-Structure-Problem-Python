Between Two Sets
Problem Statement - There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:
 1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
 2. The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
 These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

def getTotalX(a, b):
    # Write your code here
    count = 0
    for i in range(max(a), min(b) + 1):
        x = True
        for j in range(len(b)):
            if b[j] % i != 0:
                x = False
                break
        if x == True:
            p = True
            for k in range(len(a)):
                if i % a[k] != 0:
                    p = False
                    break
            if p == True:
                count += 1
    return count
